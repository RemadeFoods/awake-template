Every Thanksgiving it always seems as though there is a ton of leftover mashed potatoes. Whenever I make it, I totally underestimate how much 1 large potato makes. I remember I used 1 large potato to make garlic mashed potatoes to eat with my prime rib and it was enough to serve 4 people with leftovers! Well maybe it was because the prime was so good.

One of my most favorite ways to remake mashed potatoes is by frying it into awesomeness. These fried potato balls always hit the spot. My version is a little different as it is a variation of the Japanese Croquette which uses panko instead of bread crumbs. I find that this makes for an extra crispy potato ball. We also want to season everything as it gives everything a bolder taste. So my mashed potatoes are pre-seasoned and I season the flour as well. If your mashed potatoes are a little bland on it's own (meaning you have to have gravy in order to eat it) you should consider adding a little seasoning like garlic salt for a simple but necessary prep step). Or you could stuff it with other leftover items in your fridge like chicken curry or broken up pieces of hamburger patties to make a larger, flatter oval croquette. I'll describe the extra steps below for these optional items if you are feeling adventurous. 

# Ingredients 

* 2 cups cold mashed potatoes
* 1 large egg, lightly beaten
* 1/2 cup panko
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon salt
* Pinch of white pepper
* Oil for frying

# Directions

1. Place the flour, egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Roll the cold mashed potatoes into balls and coat them in flour, shaking off any excess. Dip them into the egg, and then press into the panko crumbs until well coated on both sides. 

   * **Optional** - Place leftover chicken curry with cold sauce or hamburger patty pieces (or anything else amazing like bacon and/or cheese) in the center of your ball first. Then coat them in flour, egg, and panko. Because we are using leftovers, don't worry about cooking the center of the ball. They will heat up in the oil as long as the balls aren't too big. Many small balls are better than some big balls.
2. Heat deep frying oil in a deep pan until it reaches around 350°F (180°C). 

   * It's recommended to have enough oil to cover the balls. But if you don't want to use that much oil you can use less, just be diligent about rotating the ball to ensure even frying on all sides. 
   * As move through more than 1 batch of frying, remember to skim the oil of panko that may have fallen off and readjust the oil temperature.
3. Fry each of the potato ball until crispy and golden brown. 

   * Don't worry about warming up the center of the ball. Be more concerned about the color of your potato balls.
4. Place each completed ball on a drying rack and serve when hungry.

   * If you leave the balls on a plate without drying, they may become soggy from the oil sitting on the bottom and the heat turning into steam. I'd recommend allowing the balls to rest for at least 5 minutes to be sure it stays crispy longer.
