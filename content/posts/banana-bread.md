When I think of leftovers I think of food that might be thrown out too early, not necessarily food that was previously cooked. Bananas are a good example of this. Everyone chooses to eat bananas at different points of its life cycle. What I think is perfect banana may be a banana that's either too ripe or too raw for you. My wife loves bananas, but they must have many brown spots and be a little mushy. I prefer yellow bananas that have a brown spot or two with a nice firm texture. My manager at work loves bananas will a little green at the top so she can feel the pop/snap of the peel when she peels it. But what do you do with a banana once it has ripened past perfect?

My mother in-law has a tendency to throw away bananas who may be past their prime. She thinks they are gross and have no use. If you agree with her well I have news for you. Bananas can still be used even in their super dark brown, mushy, slimy state. When making banana bread these dark slimy bananas are sweeter and produce a more potent banana flavor compared to the bananas we may choose to eat on its own.

What happens when I have a large batch of bananas and I can't use them all? I freeze them and save it for a day I have more time to bake. This way you don't have to make a bunch of loaves of bread to save the bananas. If you plan on freezing the bananas, peel them first as peeling a frozen or thawed banana can be very difficult. Next, separate each banana with wax paper. And finally store them in a freezer safe ziplock bag.
