  Growing up we didn't have much. Our parents would always push us to finish
  everything on our plates. They would go so far as say that for every grain of
  rice we did not finish there would be a new pimple on our face in the morning.
  I remember there was one night I did not want to eat my vegetables for dinner
  and cunningly slipped them into the garbage can with other wrappers and
  "garbage" placed on top. About 10 minutes later my dad runs over screaming at
  me saying that I should not have wasted food! All I could do was sit and
  contemplate how on earth he found my hidden veggies. 


  Now as an adult living in the crazy times of COVID-19 I am appreciating all the lessons I learned as a child. Food is now scarce and expensive. There is a shortage of pork. There are salmonella warnings on onions. Lettuce is being recalled. And I have to wear gloves and mask, risking my life as well as my family's to buy these groceries. We are in crazy times. 


  Now more than ever, we wanted to bring a dedicated website to centrally host recipes to help us remake leftovers from our refrigerators in an effort to reuse food and limit waste. I know so many people who choose to throw away their leftovers because they are sick of eating the same things or don't know how to reimagine what these leftovers could be. But with costs rising, these leftovers can save us so much money, time, and energy if we could just remake them into something more desirable. 


  Follow us and our growing collection of recipes as we embark on a new adventure, reimagining leftovers from 2 nights ago from the restaurant, parent's house, or anything we couldn't finish. Some of these recipes are from my childhood. Some are from restaurants trying to stretch a dollar. And some are from pure luck as we just refuse to throw leftovers away and try to make something delicious instead. Come back as often as you'd like and hopefully we have saved a leftover meal.
